-- ✅ 1. Self Join (Straightforward and Clear)
```sql
SELECT e.name 
FROM Employee e
JOIN Employee m ON e.managerId = m.id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;

SELECT e.name 
FROM Employee e

When solving real-world database problems, such as **“Find employees who earn more than their managers”**, there’s more than one correct SQL solution.
In this post, I’ll walk you through **5 different techniques** with explanations, pros, and actual SQL queries using a fictional `Employees` table.

## 🔍 Assumed Table Structure

| Column       | Description            |
|--------------|------------------------|
| EmployeeID   | Unique employee ID     |
| Name         | Employee's name        |
| Salary       | Employee's salary      |
| ManagerID    | Employee's manager ID  |

## ✅ 1. Self Join – Compare Employee & Manager in Same Table

This method joins the `Employees` table to itself. It’s intuitive and beginner-friendly.

```sql
SELECT e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary,
       m.Name AS Manager, m.Salary AS ManagerSalary
FROM Employees e
JOIN Employees m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID
WHERE e.Salary > m.Salary;
````

**🧠 Explanation:**
You treat one copy of the table as *employee (e)* and the other as *manager (m)*. Then filter where employee’s salary > manager’s salary.

---

## ✅ 2. CTE (Common Table Expression) – Modular and Clean

A great choice when readability and reusability matter.

```sql
WITH EmpWithManagers AS (
  SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name AS EmployeeName, e.Salary AS EmployeeSalary,
         m.EmployeeID AS ManagerID, m.Name AS ManagerName, m.Salary AS ManagerSalary
  FROM Employees e
  JOIN Employees m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID
)
SELECT *
FROM EmpWithManagers
WHERE EmployeeSalary > ManagerSalary;
```

**🧠 Explanation:**
CTEs make the query **modular**, easy to debug, and suitable for layering logic.

---

## ✅ 3. Subquery in WHERE – Short & Elegant

Cleanest approach if you only care about employee data.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, e.Salary, e.ManagerID
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.Salary > (
    SELECT Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = e.ManagerID
);
```

**🧠 Explanation:**
This uses a **scalar subquery** to get the manager's salary, comparing it to the employee’s salary.

---

## ✅ 4. EXISTS – Efficient on Indexed Columns

Perfect when working with large datasets and proper indexing.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, e.Salary, e.ManagerID
FROM Employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employees m
    WHERE m.EmployeeID = e.ManagerID
      AND e.Salary > m.Salary
);
```

**🧠 Explanation:**
EXISTS checks for the **existence** of at least one manager row that satisfies the condition, avoiding full join overhead.

---

## ✅ 5. CROSS APPLY – For Advanced, Row-Wise Logic

Powerful when you want row-specific subqueries.

```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS EmployeeSalary,
       m.Name AS Manager, m.Salary AS ManagerSalary
FROM Employees e
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT m.Name, m.Salary
    FROM Employees m
    WHERE m.EmployeeID = e.ManagerID
) m
WHERE e.Salary > m.Salary;
```

**🧠 Explanation:**
`CROSS APPLY` allows subqueries that execute **per row**, giving great flexibility for more advanced logic or filters.

## 📌 Final Thoughts

👉 There’s **no single best way** to solve this — your choice depends on:

* Readability
* Dataset size
* Indexing and performance needs
* Whether you need extra columns like manager names

---

✨ *Bonus Tip for Interviews:*
If asked this in interviews, explain **2 or more solutions**, and justify which you'd use based on **data size or business need**.

**Happy Learning & Querying!**
